Turtle inspired robot with a mix of a mobile interface

//About Me
I'm an EPM/TPM/PM type guy that is trying to work on side projects to (1) code for fun, (2) keep hands on w/ electro-mechanical things,  and (3) build something cool for my son!

//More about the project
Think robot that can turn left, right, or go forward with pre-programmed routines programmed by a person in an app. I also plan on building a "level" which is a ;hysical map/course that must be navigated/completed.
